# Step 2: Prepare the data
# X now has two features: Temperature and Hours Open
X = [
    [20, 10],
    [25, 9],
    [30, 7],
    [35, 6]

# Step 3: Create and train the model

# Step 4: Check learned parameters
print("Slope (coefficients):", model.coef_)   # m1, m2

# Step 5: Make a prediction
# Suppose tomorrow it's 28Â°C and you plan to open for 8 hours
